i.e when the Marketplace link is clicked/active ðŸ‘‡

this is what appears on the right side of the Investor's UI:

These are the pending tasks/To-Dos in the UI design: 

#### To-do instruction 1: Creation of InvestorDashboard (Joseph): 
This is what we are supposed to do: 
1. Creating a dashboard section for the investors. 

    i.e When the dashboard link is clicked/active: 

![New Dashboard UI](./public/DashboardActiveLink.png) 

    This is what should appear on the right side of the Investor's UI:

![New Dashboard UI](./public/InvestorDashboard.png) 

##### Steps to follow: 
The component to be edited is `MainBar` component inside the `DashboardComponents`. This is the filepath url: `new-frontend\src\components\DashboardComponents\MainBar`

* Create a new branch called `main-bar-investor-dashboard`
* Create a new component named `MainBarInvestorDashboard` It should contain a UI that looks like this ðŸ‘‡: 
![New Dashboard UI](./public/InvestorDashboard.png)  
* Import the just created `MainBarInvestorDashboard` component in the `InvestorDashboard` component inside the `DashboardComponents` folder. Filepath URL: `new-frontend\src\components\DashboardComponents\InvestorDashboard\` 

   This is the code in the `InvestorDashboard.jsx` component (The comments contain the changes to be made): 
   ```
   const InvestorDashboard = () => {
        return (
            <div className='investordashboard-container'>
                <Sidebar /> 
                <MainBar /> // Comment out this component 
                <MainBarInvestorDashboard> // Insert the newly created component here
            </div>
        )
    }
  ``` 

  This is the UI that should be seen in the InvestorDashboard ðŸ‘‡:

#### To-do instruction 2: Creation of FarmerDashboard (Steve): 
We are supposed to create a new dashboard for the farmers

##### Steps to follow: 
Create a new branch called `main-bar-farmers-dashboard`
The components to be edited are: 
1. `Sidebar` and `Mainbar` inside the `DashboardComponents` folder. This is the filepath url: `frontend\src\components\DashboardComponents`
2. `FarmerDashboard` component inside the `components` folder. This is the filepath url: `frontend\src\components\FarmerDashboard`  

###### Sidebar:
Add a prop that would allow to switch between investors dashboard and farmers dashboard 

###### Mainbar:
Add a prop that would allow to switch between investors dashboard and farmers dashboard

###### FarmerDashboard:
Check instructions in the comments below

```
// Import Sidebar and Mainbar 
// Add the props 
const FarmerDashboard = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      FarmerDashboard
    </div>
  )
}
```

This is the final design that should be seen in the Farmer's Dashboard ðŸ‘‡:
