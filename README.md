# Project Overview and description 
Investa Farm is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that offers loans and investment opportunities to farmers in East Africa and Africa. The goal of the project is to provide financial support to farmers, particularly those in underserved regions, to improve their livelihoods and agricultural productivity.

To achieve this goal, Investa Farm has integrated several blockchain technologies, including a specific deployment on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for enhanced scalability and security. 

## Technologies

Investa Farm employs a range of blockchain technologies to facilitate its operations:

**_Smart Contracts:_** Converted from Solidity to Rust canisters on ICP, managing the interactions among investors, farmers, agribusinesses, and supply agro stores.

**_On-Chain Frontend:_** The landing page is deployed as an ICP frontend canister, ensuring seamless user interaction.

**_Payment Integration:_** Supports ckETH, ckUSDC, and ckUSDT for fully on-chain payment processing.

**_Tokenization_:** The iFarm Token allows farmers to tokenize assets such as farmland, providing new avenues for financing.

## Key Features
**_Access to Finance:_** Farmers can obtain easy and quick loans through the platform, facilitating growth without financial barriers.

**_Investment Opportunities:_** Investors can allocate stablecoins into agricultural projects, earning consistent returns while supporting sustainable farming practices.

**_Yield Farming & Staking:_** Lenders can earn passive income through yield farming or by staking iFarm tokens to secure the network.

## Loan Process
- _Registration:_ Farmers register at their local agrostore with identification documents.
- _Application Submission:_ They fill out a loan application form provided by the agrostore.
- _Approval Timeline:_ Loan applications are processed within a maximum of two days.
- _Disbursement Notification:_ Approved loans are communicated through the agrostore, detailing the loan amount.
